@*The '_ViewImports.cshtml' file is to provide a mechanism to centralise directives that apply to Razor pages so that you do not have to add them to pages individually. 
  The default Razor Pages template includes a '_ViewImports.cshtml' file in the Views/Pages folder - the root folder for Razor Views/Pages. All Razor Views/Pages in the folder hierachy will be affected by the directives set in the '_ViewImports.cshtml' file.
